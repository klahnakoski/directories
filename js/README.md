# Directory Visualization

This is an experiment in matter.js to visualize files (circles) and directories (bounding boxes).

* related files will attract
* unrelated files will repel
* bounding boxes will contort to contain thier files

## Problem

Microservices came to fashion because of pain caused by the complexity monolithic style. I contend those pains were caused by poor modularity; organizing code by technology (dao, mapping, serices, etc) instead of by function (employees, payments, products).  The modular monolith can provide the simplicity of microservices, if it is organized correctly.

## Solution

Visualizing the dependency graph of a code project will help justify moving files to a business centric directory structure.  PLus it will show the particularly knotty parts of the code.
